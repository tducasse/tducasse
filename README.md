# Hey! 👋

I'm a french 🥖 software developer, currently living in Melbourne, Australia. I work at [Mentorloop](https://mentorloop.com/), where I help build a mentoring platform.
I guess these days you could say I'm a JavaScript developer, but I prefer to think of myself as a polyvalent everything-around-software guy 👨‍💻. In fact, I quickly get bored, so I make sure I keep learning new things all the time!

I'm currently interested in data science and machine learning. I want to build software that makes an impact, and I love the idea of open source in general - I truly believe we can build great things as a giant distributed global team.

## 💻 Languages I've coded in

Here's a list of all (I _think_) the languages I've written code in!

### Languages and frameworks I've worked with (professionally)
- Java (J2EE)
- PHP (Symfony)
- Python (Django, Flask)
- JavaScript for the backend (Node.js, Meteor)
- JavaScript for the frontend (React, Vue.js)

### Languages I've toyed with in side projects
- Elixir (Phoenix), mostly because I wanted to learn a very functional language
- Golang (have a look at [this project](https://github.com/tducasse/go-instabot))
- R for random data analysis and stats

### Languages I've learned just because, but not done anything meaningful with _yet_
- Rust: it looks great, but the memory model was a bit hard to understand, so I didn't really dive deeper
- Clojure: I really like the idea of learning a Lisp inspired language, but I haven't found a use case that's not already covered by the other languages I know
- Matlab: I have scientists friends, sometimes they need help!

### Languages I've forgotten but once knew 🙄
- C/C++: I can probably _read_ it
- Lisp: I wonder if I even knew what I was doing at the time

## ⚙ Random pieces of tech I've worked with
- Docker, Docker Swarm
- Jenkins, Circle CI, GitLab CI
- SQL (Potsgres, MySQL, Oracle)
- MongoDB
