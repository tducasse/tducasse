## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a french ðŸ¥– software developer, currently living in Melbourne, Australia. I work at [Mentorloop](https://mentorloop.com/), where I help build a mentoring platform.
These days, you could say I'm a JavaScript developer, but I like to think of myself as a polyvalent everything-around-software guy!

### Languages and frameworks I've worked with (professionally)
- Java (J2EE)
- PHP (Symfony)
- Python (Django, Flask)
- JavaScript for the backend (Node.js, Meteor)
- JavaScript for the frontend (React, Vue.js)

### Languages I've toyed with in side projects
- Elixir (Phoenix), mostly because I wanted to learn a very functional language
- Golang (have a look at [this project](https://github.com/tducasse/go-instabot))
- R for random data analysis and stats

### Languages I've learned just because, but not done anything meaningful with _yet_
- Rust: it looks great, but the memory model was a bit hard to understand, so I didn't really dive deeper
- Clojure: I really like the syntax, but I haven't found a use case that's not already covered by the other languages I know
- Matlab: I have scientists friends, sometimes they need help!

### Languages I've forgotten but once knew ðŸ™„
- C/C++: I can probably _read_ it
- Lisp: I wonder if I even knew what I was doing at the time

### Other pieces of tech I've worked with
- Docker, Docker Swarm
- Jenkins, Circle CI, GitLab CI
- SQL (Potsgres, MySQL, Oracle)
- MongoDB

### My current interests and future goals
- sitting at my desk and not going outside ðŸ˜·
- Data science and Machine learning
  - I've started re-learning stats from the beginning, and I've used Python and libraries like scikit-learn to build very simple machine learning models. Nothing fancy yet, but I'm excited to learn!
- other languages: I'd like to become fluent enough in one different language per use-case. I decided to learn more languages when I realised that my brain now associates code with JavaScript, even when some things are easier in Python.
- open source! I love the idea that the world can come together to solve problems. I like building small libraries to make coding easier. It's something I do very often at work, not so much outside of work... I'd like to eventually do more open source.
- I've tried to learn Vim one thousand times... I can get around, I can move, search, etc. I've spent _so much time_ setting everything up, but then when it's time to code, I feel so slow I just jump back to VS Code where I know all the shortcuts! Maybe one day...
