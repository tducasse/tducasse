# Hey! üëã
I'm a french ü•ñ software developer, currently living in Melbourne, Australia.
I guess these days you could say I'm a JavaScript developer, but I prefer to think of myself as a polyvalent everything-around-software guy üë®‚Äçüíª. In fact, I quickly get bored, so I make sure I keep learning new things all the time!

I want to build software that makes an impact, and I love the idea of open source in general - I truly believe we can build great things as a giant distributed global team.

I'm also (I like to think üò¨) a hobbyist game developer!. You can play my _finished_ games [here](https://tducasse.itch.io).


## üíª Languages I've coded in

Here's a list of all (I _think_) the languages I've written code in!


### Languages and frameworks I've worked with (professionally)
- Java (J2EE)
- PHP (Symfony)
- Python (Django, Flask)
- JavaScript for the backend (Node.js, Meteor)
- JavaScript for the frontend (React, Vue.js)
- JavaScript in the cloud ‚òÅ (Serverless)


### Languages I've toyed with in side projects
- Elixir (Phoenix), mostly because I wanted to learn a very functional language
- Golang (have a look at [this project](https://github.com/tducasse/go-instabot))
- Ruby, mostly small scripts, and for the fact the syntax is super terse


### Languages I use for Game Dev
- GDScript (the language used by the open source game engine, [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)).
- Lua, mostly in the context of [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a "fantasy-console" for making tiny games in a retro style, and [L√ñVE](https://love2d.org/), the 2D game dev framework.


### Languages I've learned just because, but not done anything meaningful with _yet_
- Rust: it looks great, but the memory model was a bit hard to understand, so I didn't really dive deeper
- Clojure: I really like the idea of learning a Lisp inspired language, but I haven't found a use case that's not already covered by the other languages I know
- MATLAB and R: most of my friends work in science, and sometimes they need help!


### Languages I've forgotten but once knew üôÑ
- C/C++: I can probably _read_ it. I've also toyed with it with my own game engine experiment [here](https://github.com/tducasse/game_engine)
- Lisp: I wonder if I even knew what I was doing at the time


## ‚öô Random pieces of tech I've worked with
- Docker, Docker Swarm
- Jenkins, Circle CI, GitLab CI
- SQL (Potsgres, MySQL, Oracle)
- MongoDB


## üéÆ Game Dev
I like building games, and I think that game development is one of the most complex parts of software development I've been exposed too, mostly because it doesn't involve _just_ code, but also art, music, story telling, design, UX, UI, etc.

As part of my game dev journey, I've worked with and learned:
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), an open source game engine
- [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a "fantasy-console" to make retro games
- [L√ñVE](https://love2d.org/), a 2D game framework in Lua
- [Unity](https://unity.com/), another game engine, actually the first one I learned
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), an open source digital painting software (that I use with a drawing tablet)
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), a pixel-art sprite and animation editor
- [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/), a level designer
- [Bosca Ceoil](https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/bosca-ceoil), a tool to create "chiptune style" music for games

You can find most of my gamedev related projects [on github](https://github.com/tducasse?tab=repositories&q=gamedev), and some of my games can be played on [itch.io](tducasse.itch.io).

### The "weekend-project" project
I've decided to try to do a "weekend-size" project every weekend, just to try out a new piece of tech, or just an idea that I find interesting!

I've created a badge that you can add to your repo to identify it as a "weekend project", so that they count towards this total:
